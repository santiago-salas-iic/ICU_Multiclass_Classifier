# Project name

This document is writen in
[Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html). When you're
ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use
the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want -
this is just a starting point!).

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to
yours. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed,
too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long,
consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out
information.

## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and
add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of
Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are
alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating
factors.

## Pipelines

Every project should have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file describing the jobs
a commit must pass in order to be considered a success. Check
[this project](https://gitlab.com/iic-adic/templates/templates-ci-cd)
if you want to learn more.

The result of this jobs usually can be used as `Badges` for your project.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata,
such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project.
You can [learn more here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html)
and add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding
a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots
or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos).
Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated
method.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things,
such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility
that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance.
Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your
project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a
particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies
that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful
to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while
providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to
reasonably include in the README.

## Documentation

This project has been configured to host its documentation in the `docs/`
path. Using [this project](https://gitlab.com/iic-adic/dea/pandoc-wkhtmltopdf-iic-templates)
it converts all Markdown files as a `PDF` artifact in the pipelines.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. Who is in charge, how to register
issues, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them
in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for
accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to
have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script
that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set.
Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your
future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps
help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is
especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a
Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## License

Don't forget to mention when someone can use this project (not all projects
can be used freely).
